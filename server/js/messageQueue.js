/*

this file stores all the messages that we write into the terminal command line interface...

currently, it does not work, because we don't call the enqueue/dequeue methods anywhere in the server file

we need to make sure that these methods are called and the array populates with the expected data

i think that these methods are supposed to be called within the keypressHandler file
